# Embedded AI course @ PoliMi

This repository contains material used for the embedded AI Ph.D. course @ Polimi.

The course is based on evaluation boards and material made available by STMicroelectronics.

Attendees can use a VMWare image where all SW is pre-installed, as explained [here](VM/README.md).

## Data logging

Data acquisition from MEMS sensors uses [STWIN boards](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/steval-stwinkt1.html) and [High Speed Datalogger firmware](https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/fp-sns-datalog1.html)

## Data analysis

* Jupyter notebooks
* High Speed Datalogger Python SDK

## AI models for microcontrollers

* [FP-AI-MONITOR1](https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/fp-ai-monitor1.html)
* [Cube.AI](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/support/learning/stm32-education/stm32-moocs/Introduction_to_STM32CubeAI_MOOC.html)
