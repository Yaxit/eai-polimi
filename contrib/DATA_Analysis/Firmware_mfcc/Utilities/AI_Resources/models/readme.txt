This directory contains the pretrained models for HAR using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) named as "har_IGN.h5", and Support vector Classifier (SVC) named as "har_SVC.onnx".

In addition to this the folder also contains two directories for these models converted to C-code using X-CUBE-AI. These files are named as "IGN4class" and "SVC4class" respectively.

Note that the files "network_generate_report.txt" are lightly modified to remove the personal information of the developers (the local paths). Otherwise, if you generate these files you must have similar outputs.
